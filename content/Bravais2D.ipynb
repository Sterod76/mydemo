    "The script creates an interactive visualization of the possible 2D Bravais lattices. In the visualization, the tip of the ${\\bf t}_1$ and ${\\bf t}_2$ primitive vectors are marked by a <span style=\"color: #D95319;\">red</span> and <span style=\"color: #0072BD;\">blue</span> circles, respectively. As commented in the following, only the second vector is really interactive. The script generates the resulting Bravais lattice according to the common definition\n",

    "## Guide for the use\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **The fixed vector**. Clarify the rules of the game: \n",
    "    - the script is designed to keep the smallest primitive vector as $\\hat{\\bf x}$ \n",
    "    - the other vector can be modified freely as long as $\\hat{x}$ remains the smallest primitive vector possible. \n",
    "    - this configuration can always be obtained after a proper rotation and rescaling, so it is by no means a limitation.\n",
    "1. **The Square Lattice**. Show the starting square lattice limit where $a=b$ and $\\varphi=\\pi/2$\n",
    "    - highlight this is a truely trivial extension of periodicity in one dimension and provide examples with plane waves or patters satisfying this translation pattern\n",
    "2. **The Rectangular Lattice**. Start pulling the <span style=\"color: #0072BD;\">blue dot</span> in the vertical direction\n",
    "    - break the symmetry to $a\\neq b$\n",
    "    - show 4-fold rotations are lost, but mirror symmetries are still there\n",
    "3. **The Oblique (or Monoclinic) Lattice**. Start pulling the <span style=\"color: #0072BD;\">blue dot</span> in the horizontal direction\n",
    "    - break the $\\varphi=\\pi/2$ condition and go to the *oblique* limit\n",
    "    - show mirror simmetry of the patter is lost\n",
    "4. **Centered Rectangular (or Rombic) Lattice**. Continue pulling...\n",
    "    - show that mirror lines are recovered in the limit of the centered rectangle lattice \n",
    "    - highlight how this is qualitatively different from the previous rectangular case\n",
    "    - clarify why this is also called *rombic lattice*\n",
    "5. **Recurrence and equivalent primitives**. Continue pulling... \n",
    "    - show the same Bravais lattice can be obtained over and over, in a periodic fawhion\n",
    "    - highlight how many different primitive vectors can produce the same Bravais lattice\n",
    "6. **Once again, Centered Rectanglular Lattice...**. Back to $a=b$ and change the angle \n",
    "    - as oon as $\\varphi\\neq\\pi/2$ we generally obtain again... a centered rectangular lattice!\n",
    "    - clarify this is just a rotated version of the one previously discussed\n",
    "7. **The Hexagonal Lattice**. Continue changing the angle while keeping $a=b$\n",
    "    - show that we finally end up in the hexagonal limit, where have a new rotational symmetry, by $\\pi/3$\n",
    "8. **Wrap-up 1: on rotational symmetries**. Highlight that:\n",
    "    - there are only *four* rotational symmetries compatible with translations: 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold and 6-fold. This can be demonstrated mathematically $\\implies$ **Restriction theorem**\n",
    "    - while we have *five* different translation schemes in 2D, we identify *four* families, based on rotational symmetry; in 2D only the rectangular family has more than one member (center and simple rectangular)\n",
    "9. **Wrap-up 2: on cells zoology**. Highlight the different cells:\n",
    "    - *Primitive cells*: they easy and straight-forward but not explicitly symmetric;\n",
    "    - *Conventional unit cells (or u.c.)*: not primitive any more, but they respect the symmetry;\n",
    "    - *Wigner-Seitz cells*: primitive and symmetric, but they can have a complex geometry, clarify how they are defined.\n",

    "## Key concepts and technicalities\n",
    "\n",
    "This section collects/recaps useful concepts and technical stuff about the script, from theory to very practical programming details, with the target of allowing anyone to understand what the h... this script is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### **On Wigener-Seitz cells** \n",
    "> $W\\!S$ cells partition the space according to a simple principle: a generic point in the 2D space belongs to the *closest* $B\\!L$ point. Neglecting equidistant points (cell border lines), this partitions the space in a way which is independent of the choice of the primitive vectors. For a point ${\\bf P}$ in the $B\\!L$,\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $W\\!S_{\\bf P} = \\left\\{{\\bf x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^2| \\forall {\\bf Q}\\in B\\!L, {\\bf Q}\\neq {\\bf P}\\implies||{\\bf x}-{\\bf P}||<||{\\bf x}-{\\bf Q}|| \\right\\}\n",
    "$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> How can this be achieved? The boundaries of the $W\\!S$ cells are obviously the bisection lines built from the segment joining the target $B\\!L$ point with the nearest neighbors. For each bisection line, the cell points are those on the side of the target $B\\!L$ points (and are thus closer to it with respec to the specific nearest neighbor used to build the bisection line). Once this is done for every possible pair, the resulting intersection is the $W\\!S$ cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### TechNot#1. On the (apparent) limitations of the script\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The user interaction in controlling the two primitive vectors ${\\bf t}_1$ and ${\\bf t}_2$ is somewhat limited since only one vector can be modified and there are restrictions on the vector size. However, this does not hamper in any way the general nature of this Bravais lattice visualization.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. It does not make any sense to allow a *full control* of both ${\\bf t}_1$ and ${\\bf t_2}$: the script uses ${\\bf t}_1$ to define the coordinate system in such a way that $\\hat{\\bf x}={\\bf t}_1$. This is always doable with a trivial rotation + rescaling. In the script, only ${\\bf t}_2$ can be modified.\n",
    "> 2. It does not make any sense to allow also a *full control* on the relative size of ${\\bf t}_1$ and ${\\bf t}_2$, since we could just decide that ${\\bf t_1}$ is always the *smallest* of the two primitive vectors. We will thus only allow the module of ${\\bf t}_2$ to be *larger* than one of ${\\bf t}_1$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This hugely simplifies the handling of the special configurations (symmetries etc) by making the script requirements \"less dumb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### TechNote#2. On equivalent primitive vectors\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Simply imposing $|{\\bf t}_2|\\ge 1$ is not enough since many different choices of ${\\bf t}_2$ lead exactly to the same $B\\!L$. For instance, adding an integer ($n$) multiple of ${\\bf t}_1$ to ${\\bf t}_2$, clearly has no impact on $B\\!L$. An issue arise here: even if ${\\bf t}_2$ is larger than ${\\bf t}_1$, one of the equivalent versions ${\\bf t}_2+n{\\bf t}_1$ can still be smaller than ${\\bf t}_1$ and give rise to a range of additional configuration which we *do not want* and *do not need* to consider. For this reason, the script will always limit the size of ${\\bf t}_2$ looking at the *smallest* equivalent ${\\bf t}_2$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In the specific case of the script, for any given ${\\bf t}_2=(x,y)$ the coordinates of the equivalent vectors are simply $(x+n,y)$. The length clipping is implemented by setting a minimum limit for the modulus of $y$:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">$|y|>{\\rm max}\\left\\{\\sqrt{1-(x+n)^2}|n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In practice, in the script, this is handled by choosing $n$ so that $x+n$ falls in the $[-0.5,0.5]$ interval. This automatically gives the strictest limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### TechNote#3. On the derivation of the corners of the Wigner-Seitz cell\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The coordinate of the vertices of the $W\\!S$ cells are somewhat boring to calculate. However, if we are talking about the $W\\!S$ of the $B\\!L$ point at the origin, the procedure is not so difficult. Generally speaking, the vertices of the $W\\!S$ cell at the origin are equidistant to three $B\\!L$ points: the origin plus two nearest neighbors (NN). Let us assume the two NN are ${\\bf r}_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and ${\\bf r}_2=(x_2,y_2)$. The equidistant point ${\\bf r}=(x,y)$ has to satisfy\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$x^2+y^2 = (x_1-x)^2 + (y_1-y)^2 = (x_2-x)^2 + (y_2-y)^2  $\n",
    ">\n",
    ">which in turn implies\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$r_1^2-2{\\bf r}\\cdot{\\bf r}_1 = r_2^2-2{\\bf r}\\cdot{\\bf r}_2 = 0  $\n",
    ">\n",
    ">which we can rewrite in matrix formalism as\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$\n",
    ">\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    ">x_1 & y_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 \n",
    ">\\end{array}\\right]{\\bf r} = \n",
    ">\\frac{1}{2}\n",
    ">\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    ">r_1^2 \\\\ r_2^2\n",
    ">\\end{array}\\right] = {\\bf R} \n",
    ">$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">and solve as follows\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$\n",
    ">{\\bf r} = \\frac{1}{x_1y_2-x_2y_1}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "y_2 & -y_1 \\\\ -x_2 & x_1\n",
    ">\\end{array}\\right]{\\bf R}\n",
    ">$\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### TechNote#4. On user interaction\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here we want to activate some simple level of user interaction. The `matplotlib` library can support this thanks to a few graphical *backends*. Two commons options are\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * `TkAgg` standing for `Tkinter Anti-Grain Graphics`\n",
    "> * `QtAgg` same, using the `Qt` framework\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The backend is activated by the method `.use(...)`. Note you need to restart the kernel if you want to change the backend. Suggested not to mess up with this."
